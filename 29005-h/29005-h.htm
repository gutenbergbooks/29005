<p class="center" style="font-size:150%;">PRINCE VANCE.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.</h2>

<div class="figcap" style="width: 94px;">
<img src="images/ch_i.png" width="94" height="156" alt="I" title="" /></div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">I</span>t was certainly not strange that Prince
Vance was so stupefied with astonishment
that he sat for a full half-hour foolishly
staring before him, without an effort to
move a muscle or to stir from his seat.
Indeed, it is probable that any other prince
in the same circumstances would have been equally
struck dumb with amazement,&mdash;as any one may see
who will attend while I go back to the beginning,
and relate what had happened.</p>

<p>By the beginning is meant the birth of Prince Vance,
when the powerful fairy Copetta had been chosen his
godmother, since which time she certainly had not
devoted herself to being agreeable to the Prince. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
had insisted, for instance, that her godson should pay
attention to his lessons; that he should show respect
to his tutors; and, what was most outrageous of all,
that he, Prince Vance, only son of his parents and sole
heir to the kingdom, should learn to obey. She had
coolly informed her godson, moreover, that if he did
not obey her willingly, it would certainly be the worse
for him; since learn he must, by harsh means, if no
others would move him.</p>

<p>All this seemed to Vance a most unpleasant and unreasonable
sort of talk, and, as may be imagined, it did
not increase his love for his godmother. So things had
gone on from bad to worse between them until Vance
was a fine, lusty lad beginning his teens, when one day
the Blue Wizard came to court.</p>

<p>Vance had been having a remarkably unpleasant
scene with his godmother that morning. She had come
popping into the school-room, in a disagreeable way she
had of appearing when she was least expected; and,
of course, nothing would do but she must come at the
exact moment when the Prince was engaged in boxing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his tutor's ears (without boxing-gloves), because the
poor old man wanted him to learn the boundaries of
what would some day be his own kingdom.</p>

<p>"You shall see the boundaries by travelling over
them all on foot," the fairy had said crossly. "You are
growing up idle, selfish, and disobedient; a shame to
your godmother and a disgrace to your family. You
will be associating with the Blue Wizard next, I dare
say!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so I will," the Prince answered stubbornly; for
though he really had never heard of the Blue Wizard
before, he would have said anything just then to vex
his godmother,&mdash;"so I will. I should like to see him.
I really wish he would come this very day!"</p>

<p>"As for me, you evil boy!" Copetta said, more
angrily yet, striking her cane sharply upon the ground,
"you shall want me badly enough before you find me,
I promise you; and sorrow shall have made you wiser
before you look upon my face again."</p>

<p>"Not that I shall miss you much, with your scoldings
and fault-findings!" replied the saucy Prince; and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
she vanished before his eyes, according to her startling
custom, he began shying his books at the head of his
tutor, to the great discomfort of that unhappy man,
who thought that his lot in life was indeed a sad one,
and wished himself a wood-cutter in the royal forest,
or indeed anything rather than what he was.</p>

<p>When his pile of books was quite gone, and the
blackboard erasers, the bits of crayon, and the pointer
had been thrown after them, the Prince put his hands
in his pockets and lounged to the window, whistling a
tune he had caught from a hand-organ. His twelve
younger sisters were just coming into the courtyard,
two by two, returning from taking their morning airing
with their governesses. The Princesses were quite as
good as the Prince was bad, and there could certainly
have been no prettier sight than that of the twelve
royal little girls walking along so properly and primly.
Each had a green velvet pelisse, a neat Leghorn bonnet,
and a green fringed parasol; each wore nice buff mitts
and a good-tempered smile, and each had a complexion
like pink and white ice-cream, and eyes like pretty blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
beads. It was therefore very naughty indeed of Prince
Vance to shout "Boh!" so loudly that each Princess
started and hopped quite one foot from the ground,
and even the governesses put their hands to their
hearts. This, however, gave much joy to the Prince;
and after his sisters had disappeared he stood by the
window still whistling, with his hands in his pockets
and a wicked grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness," began the tutor, meekly,
"your Highness really must not put your Highness's
hands in your Highness's trousers pockets, and whistle
that dreadful tune. If her Royal Highness the
Queen should hear you, she would certainly have me
beheaded."</p>

<p>"Why should I care for that?" asked the Prince,
carelessly; and just at that moment he caught sight
of the Blue Wizard himself coming into the court
below.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<div class="figcap" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/ch_ii.png" width="100" height="172" alt="W" title="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">W</span>hatever else might be said of the Blue
Wizard, nobody would ever think of calling
him a beauty. His nose and his chin
were long and pointed, his eyebrows big
and bushy, his teeth sharp and protruding
from his mouth; and everything about him&mdash;skin,
hair, teeth, and dress&mdash;was as blue as a sky on a
June afternoon when not a cloud is to be seen. He
had, too, a way of perking his head about, which was
most unsettling to the nerves; twitching and twisting it
constantly from side to side, like a toy mandarin. He
came boldly into the courtyard of the palace, quite as if
the whole place belonged to him; and catching sight
of Prince Vance at the window above, he raised one
finger, long and skinny and blue as a larkspur blossom,
and beckoned for him to come down.</p>

<p>The Prince hesitated. Certainly the Blue Wizard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was not so charming in his looks as to make one wish
to get any nearer to him, but Vance happened to remember
that his godmother
had seemed to disapprove
most highly of this
very wizard; so
with an idea
of displeasing
Copetta, the Prince obeyed
the beckoning finger and went down.</p>

<div><a name="i021" id="i021"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<a href="images/i021-l.png"><img src="images/i021-s.png" width="371" height="400" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>At a nearer view the Wizard looked even uglier than
from a distance. His very lips were blue, and when he
opened his mouth his tongue was seen to be blue also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come," he said to the Prince, in rather an injured
tone, "you keep me waiting long enough, I hope, when
I only came to teach you a droll trick."</p>

<p>"That is good," answered Vance, growing interested
at once. "I do like droll tricks. What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is in here," the Blue Wizard said, holding out a
pretty gold bonbon box. "Just make anybody eat
one of these, and then you shall see what you shall
see."</p>

<p>The Prince took the box in his hand and opened his
lips to ask another question; but before he could speak
a single word the Blue Wizard had vanished quite away,
and he stood alone.</p>

<p>He went slowly and thoughtfully upstairs, wondering
what the trick could be.</p>

<p>"I'll try it on the tutor first," he concluded, "because
I'm sure I don't care what happens to him, and I really
must know what the droll trick is."</p>

<p>So he went smilingly up to his tutor and offered the
open box; and the simple old gentleman, suspecting
nothing, bowed and simpered at the great honor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Royal Highness did him, and quickly swallowed one of
the little bonbons.</p>

<p>And this is what happened. Pouf! The unfortunate
tutor shut up like a crush-hat, and shrunk together until
he was as short as a pygmy and as plump as a mushroom.
Really one might just as well have no tutor at
all as to have one so tiny. How Prince Vance did
laugh! Of all the wizards he had ever known&mdash;and
for one so young his Highness had known a great many
wizards; he almost always met more or less of them
when he played truant by climbing out of a back window
and going into the woods fishing&mdash;he thought the
Blue Wizard was the most amusing and had invented
the very drollest trick.</p>

<p>"Dear me, your Highness!" said the poor tutor, in
so tiny a voice that it was quite all the Prince could do
to hear him. "Dear me! what is the matter? I certainly
feel very queer; I do, indeed."</p>

<p>"You look even queerer than you feel, I fancy,"
replied the naughty Prince, chuckling with glee.</p>

<div><a name="i024" id="i024"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;">
<a href="images/i024-l.png"><img src="images/i024-s.png" width="318" height="350" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He picked up the poor tutor, and putting him on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
window-sill laughed at him till his sides were fairly sore.
Then he began to consider how he could get the most
fun and make the most mischief out of his bonbons,
for there were not a great many of them; and, being
a shrewd young rascal, he at last contrived the plan of
putting them into the ice-cream which was then being
frozen for the royal dinner. Then everybody would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
sure to get a taste at least of the magic potion; and
slipping down into the kitchen, the wicked young
Prince succeeded in carrying out this evil and dangerous
plan.</p>

at dinner he declined ice-cream. It was
unheard of. Nobody had ever known
him to do such a thing before. The
twelve young Princesses, though much too
well bred to remark upon it, stared at their
brother with their twenty-four beady blue eyes, and
made their twelve little mouths as round as penny
pieces in their surprise.</p>

<p>Now the King, being fond of ice-cream, happened
to eat quite steadily for some moments without stopping;
so that when he did look up he beheld his Queen
already shrunk to the size of a teaspoon, and every
moment growing smaller.</p>

<p>"My dear," said he, gravely, "really I don't think
you ought,&mdash;before the children too; just consider
what a bad example you are setting them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm sure, Sire," replied the Queen, rather crossly,
for the sudden shrinking had given her quite a giddy
feeling,&mdash;"I'm sure I cannot imagine what you are
talking about. Bad example, indeed! You had better
be looking to your own behavior. What the children
will think of you for growing so very small, I'm sure
I cannot imagine."</p>

<p>At this moment the royal pair looked about on their
daughters. They were about the size of lucifer
matches! They ran their eyes down the long table;
every person there was a pygmy.</p>

<p>Horror and fear filled every mind save that of
Prince Vance. He nearly went wild with joy over the
great success of his trick. He had, it is true, run out
of the dining-hall at first, from his old habit of starting
off whenever he had performed any of his abominable
jokes; but he soon ventured to come back again, and
round and round the table he went, laughing as if he
would kill himself at the tiny people sprawling helplessly
in their big chairs.</p>

<p>The Prince helped himself to fruit and cakes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
bonbons from the table. He seated his royal mother
on top of the sugar-bowl, and put the poor old King in
the salt-cellar. As for the Lord Chancellor, whom he
especially hated, Vance dumped the bewigged old fop
into the pepper-box, where he would really have
sneezed himself to death in another minute, had not
the Blue Wizard fortunately appeared and given the
unhappy man a sudden bath in a finger-bowl.</p>

<p>"It worked well, didn't it?" the Blue Wizard observed
with a grin, as he put the Lord Chancellor, very
white and limp, on the window-seat to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>"Oh, awfully well!" Vance replied briskly, although
secretly he was more than a little afraid of this particular
wizard, who seemed to be much more sudden
in his way of appearing and disappearing than the
common sort of wizards to which the Prince was
accustomed.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," remarked the Wizard, thoughtfully,
pulling his bushy eyebrows with his long blue
fingers, "you can't change 'em back."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the Prince, in his confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
dropping his father into the pudding sauce and entirely
ruining the royal robes. "Can't change them back?
But you must change them back if I tell you to."</p>

<a href="images/i031-l.png"><img src="images/i031-s.png" width="315" height="252" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Oh, as to that," the Blue Wizard answered carelessly,
giving the king in turn a bath in the finger-bowl,
"what you say isn't of the least consequence any way.
In the first place, no wizard is bound to obey anybody
who does not himself know how to obey; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
second place, nobody can undo this particular charm
but the Crushed Strawberry Wizard."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Vance, imperiously, paying no
attention whatever to the first part of the Blue Wizard's
remark; "go and get the Crushed Strawberry Wizard."</p>

<p>"Get him yourself!" was the answer. "<i>I</i> don't want
him. It is nothing to me, you know; this isn't my
family."</p>

<p>"But where does the Crushed Strawberry Wizard
live?" asked the Prince, more humbly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I've no idea," the Blue Wizard replied
lightly; "and now I think of it, I don't believe I care.
I'm sure I don't see why I should."</p>

<p>"But it's all your fault," blubbered Vance, beginning
to cry, and sitting down upon his uncle, the Duke Ogee,
without even noticing him till the Duke wriggled so
that Vance jumped up in a fright, thinking he had sat
down upon a frog. "I'm sure you got me into the
scrape."</p>

<p>"Now you're getting tiresome," said the Wizard,
yawning. "I never liked tiresome people myself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I don't know what to do-oo!" sobbed the
Prince.</p>

<p>At this the Wizard only gave a terrible laugh and
vanished quite away again, leaving the naughty young
Prince to get out of his trouble as best he could.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">F</span>or a few moments Prince Vance continued
to cry rather noisily, though it must
be confessed that it was more because he
was so vexed at the Blue Wizard than
because he was at all sorry for what he had
done. Indeed, he did not even now realize
that the trick was likely to turn out a very
serious thing; and after a while he dried his
eyes, and having collected his wits proceeded
to collect also all the little people and put them
together at one end of the royal dining-table.</p>

<p>They made such a pretty sight, with their little court
robes and tiny jewels, that Vance was charmed with
them and declared them to be more interesting than
white mice or even guinea pigs. He could hear them,
too, if he listened very closely indeed, quarrelling and
blaming one another for what had befallen them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
this was so vastly funny to the wicked Prince that he
rubbed his hands and fairly danced again with glee. It
was only when the palace cat, pouncing upon the Lord
Chancellor as he lay upon the window-sill, snatched him
and carried him off in her mouth, that Vance began to
be a little frightened, and to realize that, having made
the whole family unable to protect themselves, it had
now become his duty to care for them and see that
they came to no harm. He just managed to save the
Lord Chancellor from the lantern jaws of the royal cat,
and then proceeded at once to set his small family in
safe places for the night. Some he put in the crystal
lily-cups of the chandeliers; others in the crannies of
the golden mouldings on the wall; while for the King
and Queen and the twelve little Princesses, he found a
lovely chamber in a pink porcelain shell which hung
from the ceiling by silver chains, and was commonly
used for the burning of perfumes and spices to make
the air of the dining-hall sweet and delightful. All this
being attended to, the Prince betook himself to bed;
but the palace seemed very lonely and silent, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Prince was so dull and so frightened that he might not
have gone to sleep at all, save for the cheering thought
that at least there was no danger of lessons on the
morrow, as the tutor was too small to teach, and his
father and mother far too little to make him obey.</p>

<p>"I will go to the preserve closets," he murmured to
himself as he was dropping off to sleep. "There is
now nobody to stop me. I shall begin with the damsons
and the honey in the morning, and I shall have all
the wedding cake and macaroons that I can possibly
eat."</p>

<p>But, alas for the Prince! when morning came he
found that affairs were turning out differently indeed
from the way in which he had planned. When he came
down to breakfast, with his foolish head full of visions
of ordering the cook to send up pigeon pot-pie, curry
of larks, strong coffee,&mdash;which was a forbidden delight
to the Prince except upon his birthdays,&mdash;and unlimited
buttered toast and jam, what a downfall to all
his hopes was it to find, pacing the dining-hall, the
fierce and cruel General Bopi, who, luckily for himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
had been out hunting the day before, and so missed the
fatal dinner, and was still quite as large as life if not
larger. He had discovered the state of affairs at the
palace; and so far from making himself unhappy about
this, he was evidently in great good spirits, and, to say
the least, was disposed to make the best of matters
instead of the worst. He had put on the King's very
best crown which was kept to be worn only on great
occasions, and with a cloak of royal ermine on his
shoulders was strutting boldly up and down, enjoying
his new splendors and the feeling of power which they
brought.</p>

<p>How it happened Vance never was quite able to tell,
but the first thing he knew, his dreams of having his
own way and ordering the servants about to his heart's
content were shattered, and he found himself somehow
pushed and hustled outside on the palace steps,&mdash;himself,
the Prince, and heir to the royal throne, turned
away from his own door and ordered to leave the
kingdom on pain of death.</p>

<p>"But my family!" cried Vance; "I hid them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the cat, and now they will starve. Nobody can find
them but me!"</p>

<p>"As for their starving," the General replied indifferently,
"I don't know that I care for that; but I would
rather the palace should be rid of the whole vermin race
of them, so you may come in and gather them up. But
be quick about it, or I'll set the royal bloodhounds on
you!"</p>

<p>Thus roughly treated, the poor Prince made haste to
collect his scattered family from the nooks and crannies
where he had hidden them. He was cramming them
into his pockets with very little thought for their feelings,
when he happened to remember his sister's baby-house,
which not only had parlors, bedrooms, and
dining-rooms in plenty, but was well furnished with
everything which the heart of little people could desire.
This he begged very humbly of the new king, and
having it granted him he packed his family into it,
making them as comfortable as their reduced circumstances
would allow. A grinning footman strapped
the box on the back of the Prince as an organ-grinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
carries his organ; then he helped him out of the palace
with a sudden push which had nearly sent him headlong
down the steps. Laughing pages ran before him, and
the Prince recalled the many times he had tweaked their
noses and stuck pins in the calves of their legs. Everybody
seemed heartily glad to see him go.</p>

<p>"Good riddance to bad rubbish!" quoth the palace
hound; "you will never again put my meat up a tree
where I cannot get it."</p>

<p>"Get out with you!" snapped the royal cat. "I'm
glad you are turned out of the house. Let us hope a
body can take a nap in comfort now, without having
her tail stepped on or snuff sprinkled in her face."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself ever to come back," screeched
the peacock, hoarsely. "For my part, I'm tired of
having my handsomest tail-feathers snatched out by
the handful. I'm sure I trust I shall never set eyes
on you again."</p>

<p>So it was with all the animals in the royal gardens.
The deer, the emus, the gazelles, the swans, the flamingoes,
the parrots, even his own particular white mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and spotted guinea pigs, declared that they were glad
he was going, and hoped he might never come back any
more. Not a creature did anything but rejoice as the
royal beggar was tumbled rudely out from his own
father's gardens and left standing alone in the highway,
already heartily sorry for his prank, and quite at his
wits' end as to what to do with the Court which he
carried in his baggage.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">C</span>onsidering that Prince Vance had
never done anything at all for himself,
not even so much as to tie his own shoe-strings,
it was a pretty hard lot for him
to be turned out into the world to get his
own living, and take care of the whole Court
besides. At first he was almost tempted to
throw away the box and all his relatives with
it; but although of course he could not be expected
to think so much of his father and mother now that
there was so very little of them to be fond of, still
under all his follies Vance had a good sort of heart, and
so he trudged away with the troublesome little Court
strapped tightly to his shoulders. I am not perfectly
sure that he did not take some pleasure in jolting it
about, for I have more than once seen little folk bang
and jerk bundles they were made to carry against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
wills. At any rate, the King and the Queen and the
Court came very near being seasick upon dry land, from
the jolting and rocking of this new manner of travelling.</p>

<p>Prince Vance had not the least idea where he was
going. He knew, of course, that he wanted to find the
Crushed Strawberry Wizard, but he did not know where
that individual lived, or how to go to work to find
him; so he only made his best pace to get away from
the palace as fast as he could, being afraid that the new
king might repent of not having taken his head from his
shoulders, and send somebody after him.</p>

<p>It was about sunset when he came to a beautiful field
which lay along the banks of a wide dark river; and
Vance, who by this time was half starved, was delighted
that wild strawberries grew here in great plenty, making
the ground quite red. He first looked about for somebody
to pick them for him, but naturally he found no
one; so he set down his luggage and fell to helping
himself, eating very fast and paying very little attention
to the rules of good society.</p>

<p>It was not until he had stuffed himself to the throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
that he happened to think that his travelling companions
might also be hungry. He opened the box and let
them out, and found much pleasure in watching their
funny antics as they stumbled over tiny pebbles or became
entangled in the grass and struggled helplessly as
if caught in some horrible thicket. Two or three would
seat themselves around one ripe berry, and dine from it
where it was growing; others drank drops of the evening
dew, which already shone in the clover leaves and
buttercups; while the Lord Chancellor, who seemed to
be always getting into trouble, picked some sort of
quarrel with a large green grasshopper,&mdash;and so terrible
did the battle become that there is no telling
who would have come out of it alive had not Vance
gone to the poor Lord's help and frightened the insect
away.</p>

<p>Under all these trying circumstances the poor nobles
kept something of their court manners; and their smiles
and stately movements, their bowings and courtesies,
seemed to Prince Vance so droll that he went into
violent fits of laughter and rolled about on the grass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<div><a name="i044" id="i044"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i044-l.png"><img src="images/i044-s.png" width="400" height="271" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>As it grew dark he did indeed stop laughing and think
longingly of his soft bed with its silken pillows and
down coverings, but in truth he was so tired he could
hardly keep his eyes open at all; and as soon as he
had picked his small relatives and friends out of the
damp grass and put them safely into their box, he lay
down under a spreading beech-tree and fell into a sound
and delicious sleep.</p>

<p>The morning found the Prince somewhat refreshed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and gave him a fresh determination. He resolved to
set out at once on the search for the Crushed Strawberry
Wizard, leaving no means untried until he discovered
him and prevailed upon him to change the
transformed Court to its former condition. He shouldered
his box and started bravely on the road, not
knowing at all where he was going, and already beginning
to regret that he had not paid to his lessons
at least sufficient attention to have learned in which
direction his own kingdom extended.</p>

<p>He had walked an hour or two when he saw by the
roadside a man engaged in gathering the down from
the tall thistles that grew by the way.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" cried the Prince; "what do you expect
to do with that?"</p>

<p>"Beds," answered the man, shortly, and without
stopping his work.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Vance said, seating himself on a stone and
putting down his box beside him. "You make beds
of it, do you? They must be very soft."</p>

<p>"Dandelion," replied the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dandelion?" repeated the Prince. "That doesn't
mean anything."</p>

<div><a name="i046" id="i046"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<a href="images/i046-l.png"><img src="images/i046-s.png" width="325" height="311" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The man nodded his head in a knowing way, but said
nothing. He was a strange-looking individual, with
clothing which was made of all sorts of odds and ends
pieced together; while so lean and wizened was he that
it made the Prince hungry only to look at him.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that dandelion down makes better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
beds?" asked Vance, whose wits were being sharpened
by his travels.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"Then why in the world couldn't you say so? You
are not dumb."</p>

<p>"Breath," returned the little thin man, briefly.</p>

<p>He moved from the bunch of thistles which he had
stripped to the next, turning as he did so and carefully
picking up his footprints to use over again and save
himself the trouble of making new ones.</p>

<p>"You are certainly the most economical man I ever
saw," declared the Prince, irritably. "I wouldn't be so
mean with my old footprints; nobody else would bother
to pick them up. And as for breath, you might spare
a little more of that; it doesn't cost anything."</p>

<p>The man paid no especial attention to these rather
uncivil remarks, but went on in his work with great
diligence.</p>

<p>"Do talk a little!" Vance said, becoming more and
more impatient every moment. "At least you can tell
me how to find the Crushed Strawberry Wizard?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" asked the man, with the first show of interest
he had displayed.</p>

<p>"I'm going in search of him."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't," was the little man's reply.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Dreadfully wearing on shoes," the other answered.</p>

<p>Then he stopped and collected the breath which he
had used in this speech,&mdash;for him a very long one,&mdash;and
went on steadily picking thistledown.</p>

<p>"But I must find him," Vance persisted, vexed anew
at this reply; "where does he live?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said the thistledown-gatherer, shortly.</p>

<p>Vance arose from the stone with an impatient flounce,
and took up his box so suddenly that the teeth of all
the Court chattered.</p>

<p>"Well," he said snappishly, "you are certainly the
stingiest man I ever saw. You can't even give away
a civil word."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" returned the old man, with an expression
of great astonishment. "Never give anything away.
What will you give for your dolls?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this question might sound like pure idiocy to
some people; but funnily enough it came into the head
of Vance that when he had been teasing those twelve
models of propriety, his sisters, a few days before, and
had made their blue bead-like eyes swim with tears by
taking away their playthings, he had used just those
very same words to them. He hung his head a little;
but still, determined to put a bold face on the matter,
he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense! Tell me the way to the
Crushed Strawberry Wizard's this minute!"</p>

<p>But, to his surprise, where the queer old man had
stood there was only a seedy black raven, very battered
and ragged, but with a remarkable pair of glittering red
eyes.</p>

<p>"Concert!" exclaimed Vance, in bewilderment.
"There isn't any concert."</p>

<p>"But there is going to be," returned the bird, more
severely than before. "I'm going to sing myself.
First, I shall sing a love-song. Be quiet!"</p>

hoarse and cracked voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded the raven, fixing
his glittering eye on the Prince. "Do you understand
the language of love?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Vance, more humbly; "I must confess
that I don't, though I've always heard it was very silly."</p>

<p>"Speaking of the boundaries of a king&mdash;" the
raven began easily; but the Prince interrupted in great
haste.</p>

<p>"Nobody <i>was</i> speaking of boundaries," he said
sharply; "you made that up yourself."</p>

<p>"&mdash;dom," resumed the raven, calmly, paying no
sort of attention to the interruption of the Prince, but
cocking his head on one side and looking wickedly out
of one eye, "they are very useful to know, and there
are various ways of learning them. Some people learn
them in the school room; that's one way: some travel;
that's&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before he could get any farther Vance had
caught up a stone and flung it at him. With a terrible
croaking the raven flew up into the air in circles higher
and higher until he vanished straight overhead.</p>

<p>"Ten to one that was Godmother herself," grumbled
Vance, as he picked up his box and started again along
the dusty road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>All the rest of the day he travelled, growing more
and more weary, until at sunset he came to a very old
woman sitting beside a great tree upon the river's bank.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" cried Vance, not too politely.</p>

<p>The wrinkled old creature looked at the river, at the
tree, at the sky,&mdash;everywhere, in a word, except at the
travel-stained Vance.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said more roughly yet, "why don't you
speak when you are spoken to? Do you know who
I am?"</p>

<p>The aged crone wrinkled her forehead and lifted her
grizzled eyebrows, still without looking at him.</p>

<p>"No," she answered coolly, "I don't know that I
do. You look like a boot-black with that box on
your shoulders, only that a boot-black would be more
civil-spoken."</p>

<p>An angry retort sprang to the lips of the Prince,
but before he could give vent to it a terrible little shrill
sound from the box struck his ears. In sudden dismay
he unslung the baby-house, and opened it to discover
what was the matter with his family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of the floor of the largest room of the
baby-house were all the Court, gathered about the old
King, who had fallen in a faint from hunger.</p>

<p>"He is starved!" cried the Queen, in a piercing wee
voice of anguish.</p>

<p>"I am starving myself!" roared the Lord Chamberlain,
in a keen though tiny roar.</p>

<p>"We are all starving!" shrieked the whole Court, in
voices more or less audible.</p>

<p>"Well," Vance said, looking at the affliction of the
little people, "I must say this is extremely disagreeable
of them all to be starving. They always are starving."</p>

<p>"Very," the old woman echoed, with a sneering
chuckle.</p>

<p>As she spoke, she took from beneath her faded cloak
a basket in which were delicate white cakes, fruits, and
honey. These she began to eat with great relish, apparently
not at all interested in the Prince or his
family.</p>

<p>"Come, now," cried he, "give me some of that!
My Court is half dead."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really?" she returned, coolly munching away.</p>

<p>"Yes," shouted Vance, vainly attempting to snatch
something from the well-filled basket, "and I must
have a cake to feed them on."</p>

<p>The old lady made no resistance, but only flitted up
like a bird, in some unaccountable way, to a limb of a
tree, where she sat eating as placidly as ever.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" said poor Vance, startled half out of
his wits, "are you Godmother too? You shy about
just like her."</p>

<p>"She is a friend of mine," answered the old woman.
"I know all about you, too, for that matter."</p>

<p>There was nothing left for Vance but to beg for pity,
and at last the strange creature threw him down half
a small cake.</p>

<p>"There's plenty for your family."</p>

<p>Vance provided for his little people, and then
began humbly to beg for a few morsels for himself.</p>

<p>"Wait," said the woman on the bough overhead,
"till I see what there is in the pantry."</p>

<p>She disappeared with great suddenness; but presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
a little window opened in the side of the tree trunk,
from which the wrinkled old face looked out.</p>

<div><a name="i056" id="i056"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;">
<a href="images/i056-l.png"><img src="images/i056-s.png" width="317" height="315" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Here are a few dry crusts from the closet," she
said. "You may have them. With a little honey I
think they will go very well."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>She handed two or three mouldy scraps of bread
out as she spoke, which Vance took with as good grace
as he could muster.</p>

<p>"Where is the honey?" he asked, eying his crusts
ruefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll eat the honey while you eat the crusts,"
was the answer. "That is by far the best way to
arrange it."</p>

<p>"You are mean enough, I hope," he exclaimed
angrily.</p>

<p>But, alas! at the word the crusts left his grasp and
appeared in the hand of the old woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," she said, "just as you please!
You are not obliged to have them, of course."</p>

<p>Poor Vance was ready to cry with vexation and
hunger, and quite broke down at this last misfortune.
He begged so humbly for the crusts that at last the
queer old crone relented and gave them back; and
never did anything taste sweeter to him than these
dry and mouldy morsels of bread.</p>

<p>"You may sleep where you are," the woman said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
as he finished; and she closed the window with a slam,
leaving it impossible to say where it had been.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," she cried, a moment later,
sticking her head through the bark of the tree, in a way
that looked very uncomfortable indeed, "about those
boundaries, you know, and the Crushed Strawberry
Wizard, I was going to say&mdash;But, no; on the
whole, it's no matter."</p>

<p>And once more she disappeared, not again to be
seen.</p>

<p>"I must say," muttered Prince Vance, "strange
things happen to me all the time."</p>

<p>And curling himself up on the moss, he fell fast
asleep from weariness.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">T</span>he morning sun shining into his eyes
awakened him; and after looking about
carefully to assure himself that there was
nothing to be had to eat in that place,
Vance shouldered his box and trudged along
the river's bank. It was a beautiful bright
morning; the birds were singing, the flowers were
opening to the light, and had it not been for a
constantly growing hunger, the young traveller might
have enjoyed his walk greatly. As it was, he soon
became so hungry that he could think of nothing
but eating. He went on, however, until about noon,
before he found any food; then to his great joy he
came upon a fine tree hanging full of ripe peaches,
rosy and plump as a baby's cheek.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now for a feast!" he said eagerly to himself, as he
put down his box and prepared to gather a hatful of
the delicious fruit.</p>

<p>Just then he stumbled over something, and looking
down saw a man lying on the grass with his eyes shut
and his mouth open.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" exclaimed the Prince. "Who are you?
Are you awake or asleep?"</p>

<p>"Awake," answered the man, without stirring.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get up then?" asked Vance. "Are
you ill?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the man, briefly.</p>

<p>And indeed he was as stout a fellow as one would
meet in a summer's day.</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing?" demanded the Prince,
who had lost all patience and who thought that the
other might at least take the trouble to open his eyes
to see who was talking to him.</p>

<p>"Waiting," the man said, opening his eyes at last.</p>

<p>"Waiting for what?"</p>

<p>"For a peach to drop into my mouth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"One has fallen beside your cheek," said Vance,
"and another right in your hand."</p>

<div><a name="i061" id="i061"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 285px;">
<a href="images/i061-l.png"><img src="images/i061-s.png" width="285" height="350" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"But I want it in
my mouth," sighed the
man on the ground. "I
am so dreadfully hungry."</p>

<p>"So dreadfully lazy, you mean," exclaimed Vance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
quite out of patience; and he began to eat the luscious
fruit. "You must certainly be the laziest man in the
world."</p>

<p>"If you think that," was the drawling answer, "you
ought to see my cousin Loto, who lives down the river
a mile as the crow flies."</p>

<p>"He'll have to be lazy, indeed, to beat you," the
Prince said, as he once more shouldered his box.
"Do you know where the Crushed Strawberry Wizard
lives?"</p>

<p>"I know," returned the man, "but I'm too lazy to
tell."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't take you any longer to tell than to say
you can't tell," cried Vance, hotly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," was the cool retort; "but if I told it
would be doing something, and I never do anything."</p>

<p>The Prince started on his way without another word.
He did not even stop to put a peach into the lazy man's
open mouth, as he at first had some thought of doing.
He kept along beside the river for some time, and had
nearly forgotten the words of the lazy man about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
cousin, when suddenly he came upon what to his horror
he at first supposed to be the body of some thief hanging
from a tree. As he got closer, however, he found
that the man was alive and suspended by a belt which
went under his arms. The man did not seem in the
least to mind being hung, but looked quite calm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
peaceful. A second man stood upon an overturned
bucket and blew into the mouth of the first with a pair
of bellows.</p>

<div><a name="i063" id="i063"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a href="images/i063-l.png"><img src="images/i063-s.png" width="350" height="327" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Vance curiously, as
he stopped beside them.</p>

<p>"Why," replied the man with the bellows, "this fellow
is too lazy to stand, so we have to hang him
up; and he is too lazy to breathe for himself, so
he pays me a groat a day to do it for him with the
bellows."</p>

<p>"I saw a man up the river who was too lazy to eat,"
observed Vance. "I thought he was bad enough, but
this is surely the laziest man alive."</p>

<p>"If you think that," the blower answered, "you
should see his cousin Gobbo, who lives a mile farther
down the river as the crow flies."</p>

<p>At this Vance was reminded that nightfall was not
very far off, and once more he started on his way.
The man with the bellows jumped down from his
bucket and ran eagerly after him. He was a simple-looking
man, with a large and frog-like mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"It creeps in the family," he whispered hoarsely to
the Prince.</p>

<p>"What does?"</p>

<p>"Laziness. If it were anything else, you know,
you'd say it <i>ran</i> in the family. But wait till you see
Gobbo!"</p>

<p>Just then he noticed that Loto was growing quite
limp and purple in the face for want of breath; so he
hastily scrambled back to his bucket, and once more
began to blow for dear life and a groat a day.</p>

<p>"By the way," asked Vance, halting, "do you know
where the Crushed Strawberry Wizard lives?"</p>

<p>"He knows," replied the blower, "but you can't get
it out of him. He's too lazy to speak; so it's no
manner of use fretting about it."</p>

<p>With a sigh of weariness and disgust the royal wayfarer
turned away and went on his journey. Just at
dusk he reached a small village, or rather a group of
poor little houses; and as he was about to knock at the
door of one to ask for shelter, he saw a procession
coming over the fields. There were a number of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
with flaring torches, one or two with picks and spades,
while in the midst was carried a bier upon which lay a
man with his eyes wide open, staring straight ahead.</p>

<div><a name="i066" id="i066"></a></div>

<a href="images/i066-l.png"><img src="images/i066-s.png" width="316" height="206" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"What's all this?" the Prince asked of one who
seemed of some authority in the company.</p>

<p>"We are going to bury Gobbo," replied the man.</p>

<p>"But he isn't dead yet," exclaimed Vance, quite
horrified.</p>

<p>"True," the man returned, in a matter-of-fact tone,
"but he does not care about living. I know, for he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
hired me to think for him these ten years. Now I'm
tired of it, and so I think it's best to bury him; and of
course it's all the same as if he thought so himself."</p>

<p>"Well," said Vance, who was beginning to grow
badly confused by the odd people he encountered, "if
he doesn't mind I'm sure I don't know why I should.
But perhaps before he is buried he can tell me where
to find the Crushed Strawberry Wizard."</p>

<p>"He won't take the trouble to remember," answered
the man, "and I'm sure I'll do no more thinking
for him."</p>

<p>"Well," was the thought with which the unlucky
Vance consoled himself, "it is something to have seen
the laziest man on earth."</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">H</span>e found an empty hut, in which was some
mouldy straw; and there he passed the
night, sleeping as soundly as if he had
been on his own royal bed of down in the
palace at home. His breakfast was begged
at the door of one of the houses in the village;
and all day he followed the river, until near
evening he came to the gray seashore and the huts of
the fisher folk.</p>

<p>"What is the name of the river I have been following?"
he asked of a wrinkled old fisherman who was
mending his net in the sunset.</p>

<p>"It is called Laf," the old man answered. "It is
the eastern border of Jolliland, as the coast is the
northern."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother boundaries!" Vance exclaimed, "I
hate them. Can you give me something to eat?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are poor folk," said the old man, "but I suppose
we can give ye a bite if ye pays for it."</p>

<p>"Pay for it!" cried Vance, in astonishment. "Do
you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"Not rightly," said the fisherman; "but from yer
look and from yer box I take ye for a travelling
showman. What have ye got in yer box?"</p>

<p>"My family," answered the Prince, before he thought.
"Do you know where the Crushed Strawberry Wizard
lives?"</p>

<p>"Not rightly," the other replied again; "but I
think somewhere alongshore. What sort of a family
have ye got? A happy family?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I hope they're happy," was Vance's
response. "I know that I am not. Perhaps they
may like being carried better than I like carrying
them."</p>

<p>"What can they do?" the fisherman persisted.
"Can they dance and eat buns like a bear, or do they
fight and knock each other about like Punch and
Judy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"They do nothing of the sort," began the Prince,
angrily. "It is not a show at all; it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then remembering that if he was rude to the fisherman
he should certainly lose all chance of getting
a supper, he became more polite, and ended by
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are&mdash;I mean they act out a king and queen
and their court."</p>

<p>"Truly," cried the fisherman; "that is a rare show
indeed! I never saw the like. Come in and get your
supper, and afterward we will have out the puppets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Upon this he led the way into his hut, and bade the
Prince follow him. It was a very poor little hut indeed,
with rude walls, in which the cracks were stuffed with
seaweed to keep out the wind, and with a small fire
burning on the heap of flat stones which served for
a fireplace. The fisherman's wife, who was old and
quite crooked with rheumatism, was hobbling about
getting the supper, which she said was all but ready.
When it was all ready, without the but, they sat down,
though the poor Prince, hungry as he was, found it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>hard work to swallow the dry red herring, the rasping
oaten cakes, and the brackish water of which the meal
consisted. When he had finished the meal,&mdash;which, as
you may suppose, did not take long,&mdash;he set his box
upon the table and opened it.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "let us give them some food, and
you shall see how prettily they can play at eating and
drinking."</p>

<p>But if the food was coarse eating to Vance, you may
well imagine that it was quite beyond the power of the
tiny teeth of the little people, who were not able to eat
a morsel. This made them wring their hands and
weep upon their tiny pocket-handkerchiefs; and the
King even boxed the Lord Chancellor's ears, so angry
was he at being disappointed of his supper.</p>

<p>All this was vastly amusing to the fisherman and his
wife, who thought the whole thing was done as a
show, and would not hear of Vance's closing his box
until the darkness quite hid the supposed puppets from
sight.</p>

<p>In the night, as Vance lay trying in vain to sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
upon the hard clay floor of the cottage, he overheard
the fisherman and his wife whispering together.</p>

<p>"I tell ye, wife," the old man was saying, "I will
do it, so there be's an end to the matter. I tell ye I
will have the show for my very own. I could make
more money with the puppets in one day at the fair,
than I make by a year's fishing hereabouts."</p>

<p>"But the boy," asked the old woman, eagerly,&mdash;"ye
won't hurt the boy, will ye, good man?"</p>

<p>"Hurt him? No," returned the fisherman, "I won't
do him no harm. I'll sell him for a sailor to the
ship that lies in the offing, and then I'll take his
show and travel about the country with it, making
money."</p>

<p>As Vance heard this, you may be sure he shivered
with horror at the idea that his family was to be stolen
and he himself sold to go as a sailor. He lay very
still, however, till the loud snoring told him that the
fisherman and his wife were both asleep, when he rose
softly, and finding his precious box shouldered his
burden, crept quietly from the cottage, and made all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the speed he could in the darkness to leave the wicked
fisherman and his hut far, far behind.</p>

<p>At daybreak he met a man just pushing his boat
from the shore, and from him he asked whither the
road along the beach would lead him.</p>

<p>"That's a thing as nobody can't tell ye," said the
man, fitting the oars into his boat, "because nobody
don't rightly know. Howsoever, I advise ye to take
it, for it's full as likely to lead somewheres as
nowheres."</p>

<p>This advice was of no great value to the Prince, yet
he felt obliged to follow it, as he dared not go back;
so he tramped on steadily, though the sun was high,
and the box was heavy, and the Court within buzzed
like a hive of angry bees at being forced to go so long
without food.</p>

</div>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">N</span>ear noon the Prince was joined by a
jelly-fish, who seemed to be of a cheerful
and lively disposition, and who insisted
upon attaching himself to Vance and going
along with him. The boy thought that he
already had quite as many people as he
was able to look after, and he told the creature so
plainly.</p>

<p>"Besides," he finished quite crossly, for he was really
out of patience, "to say the truth, you flump so that
you make me nervous."</p>

<p>"Boys shouldn't have nerves," said the jelly-fish,
coolly. "Of course, if I have no legs I can't walk,
and if I can't walk I must flump. That's plain, even
to you, I suppose."</p>

<p>Prince Vance was too vexed to reply; so the pair
kept on in silence, save for the tired footsteps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
boy and the loud flumping of the jelly-fish on the
damp sand of the shore. Near sundown they reached
a broad field where ripe grain of some sort seemed to
be growing, and
through it, shaded
by trees, ran
a brook, clear
as crystal. Into
this field the
weary Prince
gladly turned,
and first of all
opened his box,
half fearing lest
he should find
the poor little
Court quite dead
from cruel hunger.
They were not indeed really lifeless, but they
were lying about limp and white, and looked as if
there was very little strength left in them. The Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
hastily filled them several acorn cups from the clear,
cold brook, and then, seizing one of the long heads, of
which the grain hung full, he broke it open as quickly
as possible.</p>

<div><a name="i077" id="i077"></a></div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 232px;">
<a href="images/i077-l.png"><img src="images/i077-s.png" width="232" height="312" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Raw wheat," he said, "is certainly not good, but
at least it will keep them from starva&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped in amazement, and no wonder; for instead
of the grain he expected to find, the pod was full
of chocolate creams, large, and all of the most delicious
flavors, as the Prince found by trying one. He opened
another pod in astonishment; lemon drops fell from it.
A third was full of burnt almonds, while a fourth contained
sugared dates. In short, the whole wonderful
field was full of sweetmeats: cocoanut cakes and macaroons;
cream figs, marsh mallows, and gum drops;
almond paste, candied nuts, sugared seeds, and crystallized
fruits; in truth, you could not even dream of any
sort of luscious confectionery which was not growing
fresh and plentiful in that charming field.</p>

<p>Very quickly the Prince placed several fine bonbons
upon the baby-house table. The King, too near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
starving to care much for good manners, carved with
his sword, and ladies and gentlemen seized slices in
their hands and ate as if famished. A wine drop furnished
them with delicious cordial to drink, and thus
the Court feasted so merrily that it would have done
one's heart good to see them.</p>

<p>Having thus provided for his family, you may be
sure that Vance was not a great while in providing for
himself; and having shelled a fine lapful of bonbons,
he sat down to enjoy himself in peace, when to his
vexation he heard at his side the unwelcome voice of
the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>"Feed me first!" cried the creature; "I have no
hands to gather bonbons for myself. Feed me first!
I am hungry too."</p>

<p>Poor Prince Vance! He was indeed weary and warm
and hungry, and his patience was quite gone.</p>

<p>"Go and eat without hands, then!" he cried crossly;
and seizing the flabby creature he tossed it recklessly
away from him among the vines.</p>

<p>He had, however, hardly drawn a breath of relief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and was just setting his teeth in a delicious bit of
nougat, when back came the jelly-fish quite unhurt
and fully as cheerful as ever.</p>

<p>"Now, why should you take the trouble to do a thing
of that sort?" demanded the fish. "It cannot amuse
you, and it doesn't hurt me. I shall certainly flump
back again as often as you throw me away, so you see
it is of no use; and if it is of no use, why, it certainly
is not useful. I suppose even you can see that. Feed
me!"</p>

<p>"I don't see any way of feeding you," replied the
Prince, with his mouth full of sugared apricot; "you
certainly have no mouth."</p>

<p>"That is apparently true," returned the fish, amiably;
"but just lay a soft bonbon on top of me and see what
will happen."</p>

<p>The Prince did as he was bid, and had the satisfaction
of seeing a large orange cream melt gradually away as
the jelly-fish slowly drew it into himself.</p>

<p>The Prince had eaten, for once in his life, all the
sugar-plums he wanted, and had just taken a drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of water from the cold, clear brook, when he heard a
voice like thunder rolling among the hills.</p>

<p>"Who is this," it cried, "in my lollipop field, stealing
my lollipops?"</p>

<p>With his heart thumping loudly against his side,
Vance looked up and beheld a sight which might have
made a king and his army shake in their shoes; and
how much more a poor little Prince with a Court to care
for and only a jelly-fish to help him!</p>

<p>"Please," he said, speaking in a great hurry, he was
so frightened,&mdash;"please, we only took a few because
we were nearly starving. We did not know they belonged
to you, and we meant no harm. Please, oh,
please let us go this once, and we'll promise never,
never to come back any more."</p>

"Oh, ho!" cried the giant, with a great laugh; "let
you go, indeed! Not so fast, Thumbkin! I am fond
of little people like you."</p>

<p>Poor Vance danced helplessly about upon the giant's
great palm, but could do nothing to help himself and
had to look on as the giant seized the box in his other
hand and shook it gently, making the little folk fly
about wildly and get many a bruise and bump from
tables and chairs.</p>

<p>"These will amuse my wife vastly," said the giant,
as he began to stride toward home. "I should not
wonder but she'd preserve ye in brown sugar. I like
such little relishes, and 'tis a long time since I've had
any."</p>

<p>At this you can fancy that poor Vance became quite
ill with fear; but as there seemed just then to be no
way of escaping, he held his tongue and looked sharply
about him until in time they came to the giant's castle.
It was a huge gray stone building, with iron-barred
windows, and at the gate three dogs so enormous in
size and so hideous to see that merely to hear of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
would be enough to give one the shivers, so you shall
be told nothing at all about them. Horrible as they
looked, they stood in fear of the giant; and at his
word they lay down meekly enough, and did not even
growl as he strode by them through the court and
into the castle hall.</p>

<p>"Wife," cried the giant to a woman who stood admiring
herself in a big mirror in the end of the room,&mdash;"wife,
come ye here and see what I have found."</p>

<p>"What have you found?" asked she, without turning
away from the glass. "Is it anything to wear?"</p>

<p>"Zounds!" shouted the giant. "Can you think of
nothing but dress, Madam? No, it is far better than
something to wear; it is something to eat. Come,
put on the pot!"</p>

<p>At this all hope forsook poor Vance, and he thought
that his end had come indeed. But the giant's wife
spoke up sharply, and declared that it was quite too
late to be cooking anything fresh for supper, and that
the giant might wait until morning.</p>

<p>"What is there for supper, anyhow?" asked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
giant, discontentedly, for he had quite counted upon
the fresh stew he would have made from Vance.</p>

<p>"Why," replied the giantess, "there's the sea-serpent
pie I've warmed up, and I've opened a can of elephant's
heads by way of a relish."</p>

<p>"Be quick with it," growled the giant, "or I shall
eat this boy up raw in no time!"</p>

<p>At this the giant's wife, who was by no means a bad-hearted
woman, though rather fond of dress and vain
of her beauty, (and being as high as a steeple, one
must confess that there was a good deal of her to be
vain of!) gave Vance a shove into a corner to get him
out of her husband's sight; and in the corner Vance
was glad enough to stay hid while the giant ate an enormous
supper, and drank a whole cask of ale which his
wife drew for him from a huge butt in the corner of
the hall.</p>

<p>After he had finished eating and drinking, the giant
bade his wife look to it that the boy was put in a safe
place for the night; then, seizing a candle as long as a
bean-pole, he stumbled heavily away to bed. His wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
who had been sitting by the fire, now rose and invited
Vance to come and share the remains of the supper.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty little boy," she said, "and that
peach-colored velvet jacket must have been handsome
before it grew so soiled. Now come, eat a bit of pie
and drink a little ale; you want to be in good condition
for to-morrow. If you must be made into a stew, of
course you'd rather be a good stew than a bad one."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," replied Vance, dismally;
"if I must be cooked whether I like it or not, I rather
think I would like to taste particularly nasty."</p>

<p>"Oh, fie now!" cried the giantess. "Good little
boys do not talk so. I am sure you must be a good
little boy, by your looks. What is in your box?
Jewelry?"</p>

<p>"If I will show you," asked Vance, with some hope
in his voice, "will you let me go? My dear, kind lady,
you do pity me, don't you? I am sure you are kind
and good. Only let me go, and I will send you beautiful
jewels. I will do anything for you if you will only
let me go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said the giantess, "I can't do that. He would
beat me to death if I let you go; besides, you could not
get by the dogs if I let you free twenty times over.
But I'll tell you what I will do; if you will unlock your
box I'll give you laughing-gas before I cook you to-morrow,
and then you won't know what has happened
till you are fairly stewed and eaten."</p>

<p>This was but cold comfort to Vance, as you may
imagine; but he saw that the giantess meant kindly,
and he still hoped to escape in some way, so he swallowed
his sobs as best he could and proceeded to open
his box. No sooner were the tiny people free than
they began to run eagerly about the table, eating the
crumbs of oaten bread and the grains of sugar which
the untidy giantess had scattered. Small as the little
courtiers were, their jewels and robes glistened and
made a fine show; and the giantess leaned upon her
elbows and watched them with delight, declaring them
the prettiest little things she ever saw.</p>

<p>"I should not wonder, now," she said, "if my husband
would give these little things to me; they are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
small to be of
any use except
as seasoning. I wish I could make them useful in
some way."</p>

<div><a name="i090" id="i090"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">
<a href="images/i090-l.png"><img src="images/i090-s.png" width="343" height="302" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The giantess, as has been said, was a vain woman,
and she was always thinking how everything could be
put to use as something to wear.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," she said, suddenly jumping up and
bringing a spool of pink silk from her work-box, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was about the size of a Saratoga trunk. "I have heard
of ladies wearing live beetles fastened by tiny gold
chains to their breast-pins. I believe I can do something
of the sort with these little puppets."</p>

<p>"But, Madam," begged Vance, in dismay, "you do
not seem to understand that these are my own royal
rela&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, you be still!" said the giant's wife, playfully,
"or I'll pop you into that steaming kettle over there
without a single sniff of laughing-gas; and you can't
begin to fancy how unpleasant you would find it,&mdash;you
can't, really."</p>

<p>At this Prince Vance shivered, and said very feebly
indeed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please don't hurt them, dear Mrs. Giant; they are
very tender."</p>

<p>"I shall not hurt them," said the lady, "or at least
only enough to make them kick; they are so amusing
when they kick."</p>

<p>As she talked, she tied bits of silk about the waists
of the King and the Queen, and hung them in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
ears as children sometimes hang buttons when they
pretend to have eardrops. When she had fastened
on her strange ear-rings, she made a necklace of the
Princesses and Courtiers, and having put it on she
began to admire herself in the glass as if she would
never be done. After a while, however, she got so
sleepy that she could no longer see, and was even
too tired to toss her head and make the King and
the Queen swing about in her ears. She put her
new jewelry back in their box, and picking Vance up
put him into a wooden bird-cage on the wall.</p>

<p>"Pleasant dreams!" she said cheerfully.</p>

<p>And then she too went away to bed.</p>

</div>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">L</span>eft alone in his high-hung cage, poor
Vance was indeed in deep despair. He
saw no way out of his troubles, and
could not help weeping as he bemoaned
his miserable lot.</p>

<p>"It is all the fault of that wretched
Blue Wizard!" he exclaimed; for it did not
occur to him that it was his own bad behavior which
brought the Blue Wizard to the palace in the first
place.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, in a pause between his sobs, the
Prince heard a familiar flumping sound on the stone
floor below him; and looking down beheld to his surprise
his old companion the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" asked the jelly-fish, politely.
"I suppose you're not very glad to see me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am, though!" cried the Prince, not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
politely. "I should be glad to see anybody now, no
matter who. How did you get by the dogs?"</p>

<p>"I flew," replied the creature.</p>

<p>"Jelly-fish cannot fly," said the Prince; "so that
cannot be true."</p>

<p>"Well, then," responded the jelly-fish, indifferently,
"I swam; and if that isn't true, why, I suppose it is
false. Even you can see the wisdom of that, can't you?
However, now that I am here, I've something to tell
you. This castle is in the township of Bogarru, and
Bogarru is situated on the western boundary of Jolliland,
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who cares for boundaries?" the impatient Prince
interrupted. "Have you nothing pleasanter than that
to talk about?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;brings me to my point," the unmoved jelly-fish
continued. "Whenever I visit a place for the first time
I am able to have one wish come true. This is my first
visit to Bogarru. Now the question is, Shall I wish the
heathen of Gobbs Island to become converted, stop
eating their grandmothers and take to wearing clothes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
or shall I wish you out of this castle, you and your
Court, in the time a cat winks?"</p>

<p>"The last, the last!" cried the Prince, too eager
to speak correctly. "Dear, kind, good jelly-fish, do
wish us out of this horrible place, and you shall go
everywhere with me if you want to, and I'll never
speak rudely to you again as long as you live!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the fish, "I was afraid you'd choose
thus. You care more for yourself than you do for
the Gobbs Islanders. It is not truly noble, but perhaps
it is natural. Now, then, open your mouth and shut
your eyes!"</p>

<p>The Prince obeyed, and at once there was a taste
of something exceedingly bitter on his tongue; sparks
danced before his closed eyes, and directly he felt a
whiff of cool fresh air blowing upon him.</p>

<p>"Open your eyes!" said the voice of the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>The Prince did so, and to his great joy found himself,
with his box beside him, out upon a country road, with
the stars twinkling over his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, good jelly-fish!" he cried joyously, "how
can I ever thank you?"</p>

<p>"You seem to be fonder of me than you were a while
ago," observed the jelly-fish, dryly. "However, I forgive
you. If you want to find the Crushed Strawberry
Wizard, keep straight on along this road till you come
to the house of the Funny Man. Flubaloo!"</p>

<p>The jelly-fish disappeared as he spoke this last
mysterious word.</p>

<p>"What a pity!" said the Prince; "I can never tell
him how sorry I am for my rudeness. I have lost my
only friend. I wonder what he meant by 'flubaloo,'
now?"</p>

<p>This, however, was so hard a question to think out
that at last the Prince decided to give it up. So,
shouldering his pack, he started briskly off along the
high-road, not daring to linger till daylight for fear
that the giant would wake up, and, finding his prisoner
gone, would come after him and carry him back to the
terrible castle of Bogarru.</p>

<div class="figcap" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/ch_xii.png" width="100" height="203" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">A</span>ll night Prince Vance trudged on in the
starlight, and did not stop even to take
breath till he saw the sky begin to grow
red with the coming sunrise; then, clambering
over a hedge, he laid himself down
in its shelter, and instantly fell into a deep
and heavy sleep.</p>

<p>The sun was high above him when he woke, and at
once he became aware of a great ringing of bells,
blowing of horns, and beating of drums, as if he were
in the midst of some holiday celebration. He started
up, rubbing his eyes, and found that he had fallen
asleep in a field which was now gay with hundreds
of merry-makers. Flags were flying from tents and
booths; bands of musicians were playing; glass-blowers
and jugglers were performing their tricks; peasants in
gay dresses were singing, dancing, and feasting; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
there were all manner of shows and swings and merry-go-rounds,
enough to have turned your head entirely,
had you been there to see. As to the Prince, he was
so delighted as even to forget for a while both hunger
and weariness, and walked about from sight to sight,
crying "Hurrah!" as the jugglers and rope-dancers
performed their curious and daring tricks.</p>

<p>At length he came to a booth in which an old woman
was preparing over her fire a kettle of steaming stew,
which to the hungry Prince seemed to send forth the
most delicious odor of any stew he ever had known
in his life.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed eagerly, "that smells exceedingly
savory, good mother!"</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the old woman; "and truly it ought,
for it has in it blue pigeons, a fine fat cock, three wild
hares, and every vegetable and savory herb known in
all Jolliland. Will you have a bowl?"</p>

<p>"Ay," said the Prince, "that I will; and let the bowl
be a large one!" he added, as he watched the old
woman filling a goodly wooden basin with the stew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed as she held it toward him,
"there it is; and good enough eating for a royal prince,
if I do say it who made it. One silver bit and 'tis
yours, my fine young fellow!"</p>

<div><a name="i099" id="i099"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<a href="images/i099-l.png"><img src="images/i099-s.png" width="275" height="300" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"But," stammered the Prince, his mouth watering
as the fragrant steam reached his nostrils,&mdash;"but I
have no silver bit. If you will only trust me for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
I will pay you as soon as ever I find the Crushed
Straw&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped speaking suddenly, for he saw that the
woman was laughing at him. She had snatched the
basin of stew as it were from his very mouth; and as she
laughed loudly and shrilly, she pointed at the Prince
with her fat forefinger.</p>

<p>Drawn by the noise she was making, all the peasants
flocked around, crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it, Mother Michael? What is the joke?
Tell us, that we may laugh too; for you know we
must laugh. It is our duty to laugh."</p>

<p>"He wants to be trusted for a basin of broth,"
tittered the old dame, "and he says that he will pay
me when he finds the Crushed Strawberry Wizard!"</p>

<p>At this all the peasants laughed in chorus till the
very hills echoed.</p>

<p>"I don't see what you are laughing at," cried the
poor Prince, hotly; "I think you are very silly
indeed."</p>

<p>"Of course we are!" answered the laughing peasants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
"It is our duty to be silly. If we cannot laugh
at something, we laugh at nothing, since this is Sillyburg,
the merriest town in Jolliland."</p>

<div><a name="i101" id="i101"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<a href="images/i101-l.png"><img src="images/i101-s.png" width="336" height="275" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"But," asked the Prince, in vexation, "does nobody
here know anything? Has nobody any sense?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" said the peasants. "Who cares
about knowing anything, and what's the good of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
sense? We have a good time in the world, and
that's enough for us."</p>

<p>The Prince would have reproved the peasants for
talking so foolishly, but that the words seemed to have
a strangely familiar sound; and he suddenly remembered
that he had used them himself at one time when
his tutor was urging him to learn common fractions.</p>

<p>In the mean time the peasants, always eager for any
new thing, had become very anxious to know what was
in the mysterious box which the Prince carried.</p>

<p>"If it is a show," they cried, "open the box and set
it out. We are weary for something new to laugh at."</p>

<p>But the Prince hardly thought it would please the
King and Queen to be laughed at by a crowd of gaping
rustics. To be sure, he had shown them before, but
that was in private and not as a real exhibition at a
public fair. Some days ago this would not have
troubled the Prince at all; but trial and hardship were
fast making Vance into a very different sort of boy
from the Prince who was the despair of his poor tutor
and the torment of the entire palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>However, the poor wayfarer reflected that as food
was only to be had for money, money must be earned
in some way, or the Court and himself were certain to
starve. It also occurred to him that if his family still
had any feelings they must be such exceedingly small
ones that they were not of much importance; and accordingly
he opened his box and proceeded to show
off his tiny relatives, the peasants screaming with laughter
at the airs and graces of the little Courtiers, and
offering them all manner of cakes, fruits, and bonbons
for the sake of seeing them eat. The Court Priest
pleased the rustics particularly, as he seized the only
sugared almond and ran away with it into a corner,
pursued by the entire Court, all squabbling and quarrelling
in the most undignified manner possible. This
sight so delighted the peasants that they gave Vance
plenty of good silver bits, and thus he was able at last
to buy himself a breakfast, though you may be quite
sure he did not get it of the old woman who had made
sport of him before.</p>

<p>When he had finished his meal, which was eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sitting on the grass before a chicken-pasty booth, he
rose and asked the peasants politely the way to the
Funny Man's house.</p>

<p>"The house is far away," they cried, "but the Funny
Man is here at the Fair if you can only find him. You
can't always find him."</p>

<p>"This is the Funny Man," cried a jolly gay voice.
"This is I! Here I be. Why don't you catch me?"</p>

about behind a neighboring booth,
a fat little man dressed in green and hung
all over with fluttering ribbons and jingling
bells. He looked so lively and merry
that at first sight the Prince was quite
charmed with him; but he soon thought
that his looks were far more agreeable than his
behavior, for the Funny Man would neither stop
to speak nor to listen, but kept running and dodging
about and hiding behind booths or groups of peasants,
so that the Prince was in despair about ever finding
out from him where the Crushed Strawberry Wizard
lived.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you, if you please," cried the
Prince. "I have something which I must say to you;
I really must."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Catch me, then!" cried the Funny Man. "Chase
me! Run after me! Whoop! Now you see me, and
now you don't! Hurrah for me and my legs!"</p>

<p>Away dashed the Funny Man, and away scampered
the angry Prince in pursuit of him. But Vance soon
found it to be of no use in the world to try to
capture so swift a runner; so he stopped, hot and
breathless and weary, while all the peasants held their
sides to prevent their splitting with laughter, and
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Funny Man!"</p>

<p>"Do you give it up?" asked the Funny Man, as
Vance seated himself by his box and wiped his
heated forehead.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," answered the Prince, crossly. "I
should think you'd be ashamed of yourself. Why do
you want to act so, anyway?"</p>

<p>"For the fun of it afterward," replied the Funny
Man.</p>

<p>Now that at last he was standing still, the Prince
perceived that his nose was of a most peculiar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
curious fashion. It was not only of large size and
green in color, but it ended in a long and slender
pipe, something like a stick of macaroni, which was
twisted up for ornament
or convenience
into a
sort of figure
eight.</p>

</div>

<p>"For the fun
of it afterward,"
repeated the
Funny Man.</p>

<p>"Well," said
the Prince, "I
should say that
it couldn't be
any great fun, in
the first place, to be a grown-up man like you, and it
certainly can be no fun whatever afterward."</p>

<p>"Oh," rejoined the Funny Man, "that's only one
of my queer sayings, you know. It doesn't really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
mean anything. By the by, what did you want of
me?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine who was a jelly-fish," began
the Prince, "told me to ask you how I should find
the Crushed Strawberry Wizard."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" cried the Funny Man, turning rapidly on
the ends of his pointed toes. "I don't care about
doing that. Why should I? There's no fun in it.
Stop a minute, though! Is that <i>all</i> the jelly-fish
said? You are sure he said nothing more, not a
word?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that meant anything," replied the Prince.
"He said 'Flubaloo' as he left me."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed the Funny Man, turning rather
pale. "Did he really, though? If he did, that
puts matters in a very different light, a very serious
light. Come home with me, and in the morning
I'll set you off on the right road. Hurry! for we
have a good distance to go, and 'tis a roundabout
way."</p>

<p>Following the lead of the Funny Man, the Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
found himself once more upon the high-road, along
which they journeyed until late in the afternoon,
when their path suddenly plunged deep into the
forest.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" said the Funny Man; "I must
light my nose."</p>

<p>"Do what?" asked the astonished Prince.</p>

<p>"Light my nose, Stupid!" replied his guide.</p>

<p>The Prince said no more, but looked on in silent
amazement while the Funny Man untwisted the figure
eight at the point of his nose, and removed a
small copper cap which covered the end. He then
struck a match and applied it to the bottom of this
macaroni-like tube. A light like a large star at
once appeared, and shed its yellow beams about so
widely as to make the gloomy forest-road as light
as day.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for speaking of it," said the Prince,
politely, "but that's a strange sort of nose you
have."</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered the Funny Man, carelessly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
"very common in these parts,&mdash;very common, indeed.
Simply a sort of slow-match; grows in the daytime
as much as it burns away at night. Come on! I'm
going to run, and you must catch me. Hurrah! Now
you see me and now you don't!"</p>

<p>Alas for the poor Prince! it was mostly "don't."
The light flickered and danced ahead of him like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
will-o'-the-wisp, and was often lost entirely; while the
tired boy, burdened with his cumbersome box, hastened
after as best he might, stumbling and tumbling over
stones and tough roots, splashing through miry places
and running violently against tree-trunks, till just as he
was ready to sink down in despair and let his unpleasant
companion go where he would, he came suddenly
upon the Funny Man resting upon the gate of a curious
little house, and laughing with great glee at the race
he had led the Prince.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said the Funny Man; "come
in! My wife's at home, and I've no doubt supper's
all ready except the seasoning. I always
season things myself, because I'm something of an
epicure."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he led the way into the house, having
put out his light and once more wound his nose up
into its figure eight.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">T</span>he room in which the Prince found himself
was bright and cheery, and the table
was laid for supper. The wife of the Funny
Man was rather a mournful-looking woman,
which the Prince privately thought was
by no means to be wondered at. She had a
somewhat peculiar and startling appearance,
from the fact that her head was twisted
completely round on her body, so that she faced the
wrong way.</p>

<p>"Curious effect, isn't it?" asked the Funny Man,
as he observed that the Prince was staring at his wife.
"I did it one day for a joke, and the best part of it
all is that I have forgotten the charm to bring her
round right again."</p>

<p>"Does she think it is a joke?" asked the Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><br />"As to that," replied the Funny Man, indifferently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>"I don't know, because I never asked her, and I
certainly do not care one way or another."</p>

<p>"?reppus ot nwod tis ot uoy esaelp ti lliW" said
the woman, after the Funny Man had busied himself
a few moments with the dishes.</p>

<p>Vance stared in confusion, but the Funny Man
seemed quite used to this odd way of speaking.</p>

<p>"Her talk is all hind-side before," he explained,
chuckling, "since I turned her head about. Sit
down! Supper is ready."</p>

<p>They all sat down. The unfortunate woman faced
the wall behind her, and therefore she was a little awkward
in ladling the soup. However, that was a slight
affair, and Vance was far too famished to be particular.
The pottage gave forth a most appetizing odor, and the
Prince hastily plunged in his spoon and began to eat. He
had not taken a fair taste before he stopped eating with
a terribly wry face. The soup was bitterer than gall.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the seasoning?" snickered the
Funny Man. "Now, come, that's too bad, when I
thought 'twould be just to your liking!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Too angry to speak, the Prince snatched a glass of
water and drank, only to find it scalding hot and full
of salt.</p>

<p>"Try a bit of venison pasty," urged his host, pleasantly.
"No more fooling, on my word!"</p>

<p>"?opiH, enola dlihc roop eht tel uoy t'nac yhW"
asked the wife, who seemed to be as kind-hearted as
could be expected of one so twisted.</p>

<p>The Prince, however, had already tasted of the pasty,
which proved hotter than fire with red pepper. So it
was with everything on the table. Nothing was fit to
eat. The ragout was full of pins and needles, the wine
was drugged with nauseous herbs, the cakes were
stuffed with cotton; and the Prince cracked his teeth
instead of the almonds, which were cleverly made
out of stone.</p>

<p>All this nonsense was very bitter to the hungry
Prince, as you may suppose; but as for the Funny
Man, he was quite wild with delight. He rolled over
and over on the floor, and the tears of joy streamed
down his cheeks at the success of his jokes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is the best fun I've had for months," he cried.
"This is joy! This is true happiness!"</p>

<p>"A very poor sort of happiness," the Prince said
ruefully. "I think I will go to bed."</p>

<p>Alas! here things were just as bad. As the Prince
entered his chamber a bucket of ice-cold water, balanced
above, fell down and drenched him to the skin.
His bed was full of eels and frogs; and when the poor
boy tried to get a nap in a chair a tame owl and a
pair of pet bats flapped their wings in his face and
tweaked his nose and ears. At the earliest peep of
dawn the tortured Prince shouldered his box and left
his chamber.</p>

<p>Sitting on the balustrade, whittling, was the host.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">"G</span>ood-morning!" said the Funny Man,
politely. "I hope you slept well."</p>

<p>"I did not sleep at all," replied the
Prince, hotly; "and of course you knew
I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"That was the joke, you know," the
Funny Man chuckled, pocketing his knife
and preparing to lead the way to the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>The Prince, however, had no mind for another feast
like that of the night before; so he resisted all urging
and started forth.</p>

<p>"Don't miss the way!" said the Funny Man, who
seemed to be much cast down because the Prince would
not stay to breakfast. "Cross the stream, you know,
than climb a red stile, and there you are on the straight
road. If ever I come your way I'll make you a visit.
I've taken a fancy to you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's more than I've done to you," muttered
Vance, as he trudged away.</p>

<p>He was very angry indeed with the Funny Man, and
yet he had an unpleasant remembrance of a time, not
so very far away, when he himself was the terror of the
entire palace on account of his fondness for playing
cruel jokes upon others.</p>

<p>The road was rough, the sun was hot, and the
Prince was so famished that he was glad to devour a
couple of apples which had fallen from the cart of a
peasant bound for market. Still Vance cheered himself
with the thought that his troubles were about to
end. He was now near the home of the Crushed
Strawberry Wizard; so he pressed on till mid-afternoon,
only stopping once when he came upon some pears
growing upon a stunted tree by the roadside. They
were small, crabbed, and stony; but the hungry Prince
was glad enough to gather a number and eat them
seated in the pear-tree's scanty shade. As to the
Court, it was quite a relief to Vance to remember
that the peasants at the fair had provided the baby-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with cakes and bonbons enough to last for many
days.</p>

<p>"After all," the Prince said to himself, as he once
more trudged along,&mdash;"after all, they have a far easier
time of it than I. I don't think I should much mind
being little myself if I could have as good a time as
they do."</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon the Prince
reached a dark wood into which his road seemed to
lead him. He had not walked far before he heard a
sound as of somebody sobbing, and also a curious
clashing noise as of cymbals striking together. These
sounds became more and more distinct as the Prince
kept on; and at last he came to a small monkey who
was seated in a low juniper-tree, weeping most bitterly
and now and then smiting its hands together in sorrow.
The hands of the monkey, being of metal (as indeed
was the creature's entire body), produced, as they beat
together, the cymbal-like sounds which the Prince had
heard.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the Prince, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
monkey continued to weep without paying any attention
whatever to him.</p>

<div><a name="i121" id="i121"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 290px;">
<a href="images/i121-l.png"><img src="images/i121-s.png" width="290" height="325" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The monkey, looking up, wiped its eyes upon a
small lace handkerchief which was already quite damp
enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so miserable," it sighed. "Did you never
hear folk say it was cold enough to freeze the tail off
a brass monkey? I am the brass monkey. They
mean me; they mean my tail."</p>

<p>"But it never has been cold enough to freeze your
tail off," said the Prince, consolingly.</p>

<p>"No," replied the monkey, wretchedly; "but then
I'm always afraid it will be, and that's just as bad.
Oh, what a world this is!"</p>

<p>The monkey upon this fell to weeping more bitterly
than before, and the Prince sneezed violently three
times.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed the monkey, dismally; "now
you're taking cold because I'm so damp with crying."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that!" replied the Prince, politely.
"It really doesn't matter. A good sneeze is really
quite refreshing."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said the monkey, "that I was
sent to tell you to go back again; this isn't the
road."</p>

<p>"Not the&mdash;" began the Prince, looking puzzled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Road," finished the monkey, beginning to cry
once more. "To the Crushed Strawberry Wizard's,
you know. You have just come back
by another way nearly to the Castle of Bogarru,
where the giant lives. The Funny Man told you
wrong."</p>

<p>"Told me wrong!" repeated the poor Prince, now
thoroughly discouraged.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the monkey, "for a joke, you know.
Oh, my beautiful brass tail! What a world this
is!"</p>

<p>"This is the very worst and meanest joke of the
whole!" cried the Prince.</p>

<p>He shivered at the idea of being once more near
the castle of the terrible giant; and then he remembered
the weary miles he had travelled that day
under the burning sun, and thinking of these things
he could have wept with right good-will, had it not
been that the brass monkey had already made quite
a pool of tears, and Vance was afraid of causing a
flood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must go back the way you came," said the
monkey, wringing the tears from its handkerchief.
"It will take you longer than it did to come, because
now it will be night. At daybreak you will
see three silver birches in a meadow; then climb the
hedge and follow a row of large white stones till you
come to a green stile; after this the path is straight
to the Crushed Strawberry Wizard's door. You cannot
miss it."</p>

<p>"If this is true," said the Prince, "I am a thousand
times obliged to you. But are you quite certain that
this, too, is not a joke?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my jointed brass body!" cried the monkey,
mournfully. "Now, do I look like a joker? I never
made a joke in my life, never."</p>

<p>"I should be only too glad," said the Prince, as
he turned to go, "to do something to cheer you up, if
I might."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" wailed the monkey; "nobody can do
anything. Besides, I like to be miserable; it is the
only comfort I have. Go! it is getting darker every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
minute. Oh, my brass toes and fingers, what a world
this is!"</p>

<p>At this the monkey wept so violently that Vance had
to give up all idea of thanking him or even of saying
good-by; so he contented himself by turning and hastening
back along the path by which he had come.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">N</span>early all night the Prince kept on over
the stony road. When the sky grew gray,
he took a short nap under a thorny hedge,
and by sunrise he was once more on his
way. On his right, in a beautiful green
field, he saw to his great delight three silver
birches, their branches rustling lightly in the
morning wind.</p>

<p>Vance climbed the hedge and walked on
steadily, being guided, as the monkey had
promised, by a seemingly endless row of pure white
stones. At noon he came upon a green stile, but it
was so crooked that the Prince thought he could more
easily climb the hedge than get over it. As he drew
nearer he perceived a curious little man, who appeared
to be hunting for something in the grass at the foot
of the stile. He was a good-natured-looking old man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
but his head, body, arms, and legs, even his features,
were twisted so that nothing about him was fair or
straight. He greeted the Prince very kindly, however,
and invited him to sit down by the brook and share
his luncheon of bread and cheese. This, you may
imagine, the famished Prince was only too glad to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've heard, perhaps," said the stranger, "of the
crooked man who walked a crooked mile and found a
crooked sixpence against a crooked stile? I am the
man. I haven't found the sixpence yet, but hope
to do so soon. I want to warn you, when you reach
the Crushed Strawberry Wizard's, not to speak until
he has spoken, or you'll spoil the charm for ten
years."</p>

<p>"How good you are!" exclaimed the Prince, gratefully.
"How terrible if, after all my journeying, I had
spoilt the charm! Can I do anything for you? I will
help hunt for the sixpence if you like, or I will beg
the Wizard to untwist you."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind!" returned the Crooked Man, cheerfully.
"As to the sixpence, I must find that myself;
and as to my crookedness, a whirlwind did it and a
whirlwind must undo it. I don't mind. You see, I do
not feel as badly as I look."</p>

<p>Thanking the kind little man once more for his
luncheon and his good advice, Vance started off merrily
through the beech-wood, feeling that his toilsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
journey was truly drawing to an end at last. The birds
sang, the brook babbled cheerfully beside him, and
the breeze brought him sweet odors from a thousand
flowers. Just at sunset the Prince left the wood, and
came into a small open glade where the grass was like
cool green velvet to his feet, and a crystal fountain
splashed in the midst of a bed of flowers. Here Vance
beheld a curious pink house shaped like an enormous
strawberry; and before the door, busily making tatting,
was a strange-looking person, all of a pinkish magenta
color even to his hair, and wearing a gown and pointed
hat of the same unpleasant hue.</p>

<p>Prince Vance had found the Crushed Strawberry
Wizard at last.</p>

</div>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">I</span>t was well that Vance had been warned
by the Crooked Man not to speak first,
as he certainly would have done so, for in
truth the Crushed Strawberry Wizard did
not appear to be at all a talkative sort of
man. He did indeed look up as Vance
came near and put down his box; but
he said nothing, and closing his eyes, went on making
tatting in silence.</p>

<p>Vance stood on one foot awhile, and then on the
other. He counted the white doves upon the peaked
roof, and watched a small old lady who was gathering
herbs in the tiny garden beside the house; but he
was very careful not to speak. At last his patience
was rewarded. The Wizard opened his eyes and
spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"The reason," he said very slowly, "that a sausage
cannot walk is that it has no legs. You can understand
that, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!" replied the Prince, politely.</p>

<p>He was extremely anxious not to say anything to
make the Wizard angry.</p>

<p>"Well, then," returned the Wizard, "don't pretend
that you can't, that's all."</p>

<p>For some time longer the Wizard made tatting in
silence; then once again he spoke.</p>

<p>"The reason," he said gravely, "that a horse has no
trunk is because it is not an elephant. Can you see
the philosophy of that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your&mdash;" "Majesty," the Prince was about to
say, in his eagerness to be polite; but he changed his
mind just in time, and said courteously, "Yes, your
Wizardship."</p>

<p>This appeared to please the Wizard, for he bent his
head three times and invited the Prince in to tea. The
table was already spread; and seated about it were the
old lady Vance had seen herb-gathering, and nine black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
cats with green eyes, peaked caps, and nice white napkins
under their chins. The Wizard placed a chair for
the Prince.</p>

<p>"This is my wife," he said, waving his hand toward
the tiny old lady. "She is a professional witch. She
eats nothing but grasshoppers gathered when the moon
is full."</p>

<p>The Wizard here lowered his voice mysteriously and
bent toward Vance.</p>

<p>"Economical," he said, "very economical. She
hardly costs me a groat a year, except for her high-heeled
shoes; those come dear, but she must have
them, being a professional witch, you know. Now, as
to these cats, how many lives should you guess they
had among them, eh?"</p>

<p>"I have heard," replied the Prince, "that every cat
has nine lives, so I should think that there must be
eighty-one lives here."</p>

<p>"You'd be wrong, then," said the Wizard, "for
some of these cats have only one or two lives left. I
keep 'em, you understand, so that when folks lose their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
lives, all they have to do is to come to me and I can
sell them new ones from the cats."</p>

<p>"Do the cats like it?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"They don't mind," replied the Wizard. "Anyhow,
they know they've all got to come to it. When the last
life is gone, a cat turns into a wind; you've heard them
of a March night, yowling about the castle turrets."</p>

<p>"The moon," said the witch, speaking for the first
time, "being probably if not otherwise added to this
whose salt, magnifying."</p>

<p>"You are right, my dear," said the Wizard, "as you
always are. The boy <i>is</i> better off in bed."</p>

<p>Upon this the Wizard left the table and led Vance
to a neat little bed-chamber, where he bade him good-night.
The Prince, having opened his box to give his
family some air, lay down and enjoyed the first night
of slumber in a bed which he had known since leaving
the palace.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfasting with the Wizard,
the witch, and the cats, the Prince was called into
the garden and given a spade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just dig awhile, as we talk," said the Wizard, seating
himself, "and see if you can find any Greek roots.
My wife wants some for a philter she is making."</p>

<div><a name="i134" id="i134"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;">
<a href="images/i134-l.png"><img src="images/i134-s.png" width="347" height="350" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Tintypes," observed the witch, "catnip promulgating
canticles concerning emoluments, producing."</p>

<p>Vance stared; but the Wizard, who was evidently
accustomed to this odd sort of talk, answered quietly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right, as usual, my dear. He must be very
careful not to cut them in two with his spade."</p>

<p>The Prince took the spade and began to dig, though
not very hopefully. The truth was, he had never been
at all successful in finding Greek roots himself; and
besides he was longing to ask the Wizard for the
charm which should restore his family. However, he
dug away bravely and said nothing till the Wizard
spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the Wizard, at length, "that, as to
your family, you know the rule for simple reduction,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Prince, doubtfully, "I do if that
page wasn't torn out of my book. However, I could
learn it."</p>

<p>"Learn it, then," said the Wizard; "and when you
have learned it, use it."</p>

<p>"But, if you please," ventured the Prince, humbly,
"they are already reduced to the lowest terms. I
don't wish to reduce them any more."</p>

<p>"All right, then," replied the Wizard, crossly; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
truth was, that, having a variety of affairs on his mind that
day, he had forgotten that Vance's Court were pygmies,
and was thinking they were giants, and a wizard never
likes to find himself mistaken. "All right, then; don't
reduce them. I'm sure I don't care what you do."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" begged the Prince, with tears
in his eyes. "Please don't act as if you didn't care!
Oh, your Wizardship, I've come so far to find you,
and I've met such unpleasant people, and such horrible
things have happened to me on the way, pray do not
refuse to help me now that I have found you at last!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," returned the Wizard, "be polite, and
do as I tell you. Do you find any roots, by the by?"</p>

<p>"Not one," said the Prince, leaning on his spade
in despair.</p>

<p>"That's bad," said the Wizard. "I would sell the
charm to you for one Greek root."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the Prince, "my tutor has some, I know.
His head used to be full of them; and unless they have
grown so small that he has lost them, I'll be bound he
has them still."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this the Prince hastened to open his box,
and, to his great delight, succeeded in obtaining from
his tutor several Greek roots which, though small,
were of good shape and in fair condition. These
being given to the Wizard, and by him handed to the
witch, the Prince waited eagerly for the charm to be
told him.</p>

<p>But the Wizard had apparently no mind to speak.
He whistled a few moments, and then, drawing a
string from his pocket, began to make a cat's-cradle
over his long crushed-strawberry fingers.</p>

<p>"I've sent a message by telegraph to the court cat,"
he announced. "Go through that white gateway, and
you'll come to the high-road. It is the southern
boundary of Jolliland. Your way is straight. By
sunset you will be at the castle. The cat knows all."</p>

that he felt some delicacy in asking
a favor from her now. However,
he kept on in the direction pointed
out, passed through the white gate, and started forth
merrily enough along the high-road. He was disturbed,
indeed, by some fears of the wicked General
Bopi; but he had, in spite of himself, some faith in
the Crushed Strawberry Wizard, and he meant to be
very cautious in approaching the palace.</p>

<p>By sundown, as the Wizard had promised, the young
Prince found his long journey ended, and beheld at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
last the dear old home where he was born and had
always lived till his own misdoings sent him forth.
How beautiful it looked to the worn and footsore Prince,
with its velvety terraces, its clear blue lake, marble
statues, and crystal fountains, lovely flowers, waving
ferns, and shady trees, and, above all, the great golden
palace itself, its turrets flashing and glittering in the
rays of the setting sun! The Prince could have wept
for very joy.</p>

<p>Everything about the palace seemed wonderfully
still. The white swans slept upon the lake, and
the peacocks stood like jewelled images upon the
terrace.</p>

<p>Peeping about cautiously for any signs of the wicked
General, the Prince made his way softly through the
shrubbery till he was very near the front entrance of the
palace. Still no signs of the pretended king. The
court cat, sleeker than in the days when Vance made
her life a burden, sat alone on the upper step, placidly
washing herself.</p>

<p>"You may as well come out from behind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
almond-tree," she said, "for I see you plainly
enough."</p>

<p>At this the Prince came out, still cautiously looking
about him, and set his box down upon the
steps.</p>

<p>"Dear cat," he said politely, "how do you
do?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" replied Tabby, rather unpleasantly.
"'Dear cat!' How touching!"</p>

<p>"I've been gone a long time," ventured the Prince.</p>

<p>"That may be," returned the cat; "the days have
passed swiftly enough with us here. We have not
grown thin in your absence."</p>

<p>"That is true," the Prince assented rather shamefacedly,
and he hastened to change the subject.
"Where is everybody?"</p>

<p>"Beheaded," replied the cat, briefly; "that is, all
but the King."</p>

<p>"Do you mean General Bopi?" asked the Prince.
"You know I have the real King here in my
box."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't quibble!" retorted the cat, sharply. "A
king is known by his deeds. If you have seen the way
he's been beheading people
right and left, I think you'd call him
something more than a general. What few he has
left alive have fled from the palace and are hiding in
the woods."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"And where is the Gen&mdash;King himself?" asked
Vance, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the cat, carelessly, "he's 'round."</p>

<p>"'Round where?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"'Round here," the cat replied.</p>

<p>"I don't see him," said the Prince, with a start, as
he looked about him on all sides.</p>

<p>"No?" said the cat. "That's because you can't
see through me."</p>

<p>"How very strangely you talk, cat!" exclaimed
Vance. "I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well," returned the cat, "you know those funny
bonbons?"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured the Prince, hanging his head a
bit and blushing.</p>

<p>"One rolled under the sofa," the cat observed
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Vance, "I remember that one was
dropped and I couldn't find it."</p>

<p>"After the telegram reached me from the Crushed
Strawberry Wizard," remarked the cat, "I rolled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
bonbon out into the middle of the floor. It was a
pretty pink bonbon, and the King, coming into the
room, saw it and gobbled it up."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed the Prince, breathlessly, "what
then?"</p>

<p>The cat put out her tongue and licked her chops.</p>

<p>"He was very tender," she said.</p>

<p>"You ate him?" he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>The cat placidly nodded her head, her whiskers
twitching with the remembrance of her feast.</p>

<p>"Then," cried Prince Vance, joyously, "my father
is King again, or will be when he is made big enough.
You say you had a telegram from the Crushed
Strawberry Wizard. Tell me, do tell me, dear cat,
what it said."</p>

<p>"I can't till midnight," said the cat, "or all will
be spoiled, and the charm won't work."</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="drpcap">B</span>efore he left home the Prince would
have stamped about and made a great
uproar at being obliged to wait even a
minute for anything he wanted; but of late
he had learned, among other lessons, the lesson
of patience; so he neither stormed nor
cried, but entering the palace seated himself where
he could see the great hall-clock and watch for
midnight.</p>

<p>He was so weary, however, that he could not keep
his eyes open, and presently he was as sound asleep
as a dormouse. At length the cat touched him on
the shoulder, her claws pricking him so that he sprang
up in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" said the cat; "the clock will strike
twelve in seven minutes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, have I been asleep?" asked the Prince,
rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>"It looks like it," replied the cat. "Why did you
leave the Court shut up in the box?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth," the Prince confessed, "I was
afraid they might be running about the floor in the
dark and&mdash;something might eat them by mistake."</p>

<p>"Well," the cat answered, with a look as near a
blush as a cat can come to such a thing, "you may
be right. One never can tell what may happen. It
is now almost on the stroke of twelve, and we must
make haste. Run out to the terrace and see if the
peahen has laid an egg. If she has, bring it in here
to me; and be very quick!"</p>

<p>Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, the Prince hastened
to do as he was bid. He found an egg, indeed,
and rushing back to the palace reached the
hall just as the clock sounded the first stroke of
twelve.</p>

<p>"Break it exactly across the middle, and do it with
three blows," the cat commanded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince obeyed, and from the shattered fragments
of the shell, just as the last stroke of twelve
ceased, out stepped the Fairy Copetta, as sharp, fresh,
and brisk from top to toe as if she had just been
made, and not in
the least as if she
had found her quarters
in the peahen's
egg either close
or confining. She
shook out her petticoat
with a brisk
little flirt, hopped
lightly down from
the table, and hit the
Prince a tap on the
head with her cane.</p>

</div>

<p>"Well," she said sharply, "how about the Blue
Wizard? Do you like him as well as you thought
you should?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," stammered the poor Prince, decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
taken aback by his godmother's sudden appearance.
"Did I say I liked him? I had forgotten&mdash;I
mean I don't like him at all, if you please,
Godmother."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the old lady, mockingly, "don't
you, really? Yet, if I remember rightly, you quite
longed for a visit from him a while ago. Well, then,
how about the giant of Bogarru and the Funny Man,
both intimate friends of mine&mdash;did you like them, eh?
Did you find them witty and agreeable? Did they
treat you with great respect because you were a real
live prince, eh?"</p>

<p>"You know they did not," cried the Prince. "I
must say, Godmother, that you have strange taste in
choosing friends."</p>

<p>"Each to his liking," responded Copetta, lightly.
"I dare say, now, that you found more pleasure in
that stupid jelly-fish, or that dismal brass monkey,
or that crooked man,&mdash;and <i>he's</i> a beauty, by the
way!"</p>

<p>"I did like them," replied the Prince, stoutly; "they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
were so good to me. Are they, too, friends of yours,
Godmother?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the fairy, her bright eyes twinkling
elfishly, "I think I may say that they're rather intimate
with me."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," ventured Vance, rather timidly,
"but they might all be you, Godmother."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think," she answered tartly, "that I
am a sort of living multiplication-table, or that I
have as many lives as a cat. By the way, can you
bound the kingdom now?"</p>

<p>"I ought to be able to bound it," the Prince replied;
"I have been quite around it on foot."</p>

<p>"Well," returned his godmother, acidly, "I dare say
it hasn't hurt you. That reminds me; have you had
enough of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Godmother," cried the Prince, "I have
had enough of everything but kindness; and oh, Godmother,
if you only would tell me how to turn my
people back again, indeed, there is nothing I wouldn't
do. Believe me, dear Godmother, I'm a very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sort of boy from the one who wouldn't learn the
boundaries, and wanted to know the Blue Wizard; I
am, indeed."</p>

<p>"Humph!" sniffed the fairy, though secretly she
was not ill pleased with him, "you're a much dirtier
one, at all events. Have you washed your face since
you've been gone?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I haven't washed it very often," confessed
the humbled Prince. "You see, I've had so
much else on my mind, Godmother."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed the fairy. "Go take a bath!"</p>

<p>"But the Court, Godmother," pleaded the Prince,
timidly; "they must be very tired of being small."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," cried the godmother, sharply, "how you
do harp on one string, to be sure! 'Tis very ill bred of
you. However, as it's not for yourself, I don't mind
telling you that it's a very simple matter when you
once know how to do it. They were facing each
other when they shrank, were they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Prince, blushing.</p>

<p>"Turn them all back to back, then," said the fairy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
snappishly. "I should think any fool might have
known enough to do that long ago."</p>

<p>Vance opened his box, and trembling with excitement
arranged his relatives and friends in two rows,
back to back.</p>

<p>Pouf! The effect was magical! Quicker by far
than they had grown small, the little folk regained
their former size. Then, indeed, confusion reigned.
Such gabbling and chattering and running about; such
hand-shakings, embracing, and congratulations; such
beratings and cuffings of Vance because he had made
them small, and then such kissings and caressings
because he had made them large again! Never was
there known such a mighty confusion and uproar in
any royal palace before or since.</p>

<p>"But, Godmother," ventured Vance, timidly, when
the excitement had died away enough to allow a body
to begin once more to think,&mdash;"But, Godmother, if
you please, may I ask you one question?"</p>

<p>"If it's a short one," replied the sharp old lady,
"and not <i>too</i> foolish."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," asked Vance, "I would like very
much to know, if you please, what we should have
done if the peahen had happened not to lay an
egg?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said the godmother, crisply. "Stuff!"</p>
